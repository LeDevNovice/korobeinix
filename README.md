### Why “Korobeinix” ?

> _Korobeiniki_ is the 19th-century Russian folk tune that became the iconic “Type A” theme on Nintendo’s 1989 Game Boy release of **Tetris**.  
> By shortening it to **Korobeinix** and adding the gaulish-sounding “-ix”, I set a light-hearted, colourful tone for the project that also recalls classic French comics.  
> Just as travelling peddlers (_korobéyniki_) carried boxes of goods, our blocks travel down the grid, stacking neatly into lines.
