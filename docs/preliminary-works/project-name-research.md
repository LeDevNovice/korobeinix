| **Stakan 84** | *stah-KAHN eighty-four* | *Stakan* (стака́н, “glass”) is the Russian nickname for the play-field well; **1984** is the year Alexey Pajitnov created the very first Tetris prototype. | **Stakan 84** pays tribute to Alexey Pajitnov’s original build: back in 1984, tetrominos were already falling into a *stakan* rendered on an Elektronika-60 terminal. |
| **Korobeinix** | *ko-ro-BAY-nix* | Shortened from **Korobeiniki**, the 19th-century Russian folk song that became the famous “Type A” theme of the 1989 Game Boy version. The “-ix” ending playfully echoes French comic heroes. | **Korobeinix** evokes the unforgettable Game Boy melody and the lively cadence that drives each falling block. The “-ix” ending gives it a cheerful, cartoon vibe while nodding to the project’s French roots. |

### Why I chose “Korobeinix”

> *Korobeiniki* is the 19th-century Russian folk tune that became the iconic “Type A” theme on Nintendo’s 1989 Game Boy release of **Tetris**.  
> By shortening it to **Korobeinix** and adding the gaulish-sounding “-ix”, I set a light-hearted, colourful tone for the project that also recalls classic French comics.  
> Just as travelling peddlers (*korobéyniki*) carried boxes of goods, our blocks travel down the grid, stacking neatly into lines.
